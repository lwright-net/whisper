#+title: Whispernotes

* Notes for openai whisper
** gpu tests
+ running the ai with a gpu utilizes 100% of the gpu power on a 1060 6gb and pins a single cpu core at 100%
+ 4.5 minuet run-time using the medium size model on a 1060 6gb gpu on a 10 minuet podcast
+ 1.5 minuet run-time using the small size model with the same gpu and podcast
** cpu tests
+ running the ai using cpu only it utilizes the whole cpu in my tests ( pins all cores at 100% )
+ my test machine is a VM virtualied using kvm and qemu and I have allocated 8 cpu threads to the cpu for the VM
+ using the medium size model and the same podcast cpu only I had a wall-clock time of 41 minuets and a cpu time of 5.5 hours
+ using the small size model and the same podcast cpu only I had a wall-clock time of 12 minuets and cpu time of 1.5 hours
